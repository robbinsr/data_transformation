tidy_data
========

You are now reading the **README.md** document in the **tidy_data** repository (e.g., folder) on GitHub.com in a set of directories maintained by Russ Robbins.

This repository contains data that was collected from thirty individuals whose physical actions were measured using a mobile phone that was attached to these participants. This data is in the folder named raw_data. The raw data and how it was collected is explained in the file named **raw_data_description.md** in the raw_data folder. 

The program that transforms the raw data, so that it is easier to use, is named **run_analysis.R**. The document which explains what the program does is named **run_analysis_description.md**. The document that explains any changes in the labels of the data is named **code_book.pdf**. All of these files are in the folder **tidy_merge_program**.

The transformed data is in the **tidy_merged_data** folder.
