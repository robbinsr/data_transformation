tidyData
========

You are now reading a document in the **tidyData** repository (e.g., folder/directory) on GitHub.com in a set of directories maintained by Russ Robbins.

This repository contains data that was collected from thirty individuals whose physical actions were measured using a mobile phone that was attached to these participants. 

The raw data and how it was collected is explained in the file named **rawDataDescription.md**. 

The program that transforms the raw data, so that it is easier to use, is named **run_analysis.R**.

The document that explains any changes in the labels of the data is named **codeBook.pdf**. 

The transformed data is in the **tidyMerged** repository.
